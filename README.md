# Hi, I'm Shynji Robbie Miyasato

**I'm currently studying at IFMS**

For an year I've been learning programming languages such as C++, Java and Python. Though I'm not really good at coding, I really enjoy the activity and I try to improve and learn more about it as much as possible. It is a way I've found to practice english and learn more about different topics regarding computers.
